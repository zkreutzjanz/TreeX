# TreeX - A lighweight gedcom file viewer
## About
Gedcom files are readable in plain text, but not easily. This cli tool allows for gedcom files to be opened and traversed via a simple lightweight UI. Ideally this program would be coupled with gedcom backups as a safekeep for future viewing. 
## Usage
Built for windows, have not tested anything else (in theory it should be portable). Compile "Main.cpp" with choice of compiler, or use an init file from the "tests" folder. Run ..treeX view <filename> to view a file, then "Initialize and open Tree". View cli description file via ..treeX -h. Usage inside of program should be straightforward.
## Note
Not all gedcom file types are supported, their may be bugs, as gedcoms are not standardized. This is based on gedcom version 5.5.1 lineage linked.
